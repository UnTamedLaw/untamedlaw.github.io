	The paper assessed Swedish men who have received four or more years in jail for violent crimes to two different test to see if there needs to be any changes to the psychopathy checklist-revised (PCL-R). The men were first assessed with the PCL-R in order to measure their level of psychopathy reported by this test. The men were then assessed their level of low anxiety and fearlessness(LAF) in order to see if they were any personality subtypes that the PCL-R didn’t account for. After comparing the two assessments using statistical methods, the researchers found that LAF isn’t separate from the PCL-R and is implicitly included. The results support that the PCL-R is comprehensive when assessing for psychopathy in individuals. 

-PCL: R is a Psychopathy checklist used to assess if someone has psychopathy. 
-Attenuation hypothesis: Humans aren’t able to perceive all their sensory inputs at a time. This means that humans can only choose which one that is most important. 
-Unidimensional measure: measurements from an assessment can be placed on a single number line. Can oversimply results. 
-Structural Equation Modeling: Statistical measure to test whether variables are interrelated by examining the variances of the variables. 
-latent variables: variables not directly observed but inferred from other observed variables.
